classMate aims to solve the issues of getting class attendance, input, and progress in real time. Students will be able to check-in to the class via web panel (restricted to certain ip range? ie. must be on school wifi to mark present), submit deliverables, see live presentations, take notes, and participate in live feedback. Instructors will be able to view statistics for the class attendance and submissions as well as create feedback sessions and share files. Instructors will also be able to set Todo's/Deadlines for the class that will show up in the student's notifications.
